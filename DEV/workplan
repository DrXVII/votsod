=== Objectives =================================================================
- Organise project repository and throw out the rubbish.
- Flesh out the core of the engine
-- core machanics
-- basic AI/mobs
-- basic level generation
-- line of sight

=== Steps ======================================================================

# Flesh out the core of the engine
(the idea is to make a reusable engine skeleton)

## core mechanics
- implement treating the main char as one of the char objects in the map
	and render as such. (Throw away the hard-stamped '@' at middle of view-port
	placeholder)
	  [salvaged old description]
		- Create an array of char objects in the Map object
		- place main char in the array
		- reconfigure viewport accordingly
					v	v	v
		- later base the mob class inheritance off of the Character class
		- then the main char and all the mobs and npc's would perform their turns as
		system iterates through the array
		[END]

- reintroduce wall collisions

## basic AI/mobs
- basic mobs
-- introduce an AI-less mob (let's consider it a training dummy :D )
-- implement basic mob AI (only homing for now)

## basic level generation
- generate a random level (for now some generic rooms connected with corridors)
	for testing

## line of sight
- basic line of sight (no worries about obstacles for now)
-- player (display render)
-- mob AI behaviour

=== Ideas ======================================================================

# Core Engine mechanics
- Levels of illumination
-- Calculate per tile
-- Effects on line of sight
-- Illuminating with objects (sconces, carried torches or other equipment)

- Flowing fluids.

# Gameplay
- The player will have the ability to enter a person's inner world at certain
	circumstances. Each world would have a certain flavour depending on the
	main principality/inhabitants. Each world would be unique as it would be
	randomly generated each time in accordance to the prevalent theme of the
	level.

- open space enviornment
