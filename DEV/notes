*** The notes file ***
This is a place to take notes of things that spontaneously come to mind
and seem of value, to later be sorted, reviewed and put into other
files or be deleted.

- Schedule a monthly game report (for self or place it on the web) to help self
track the progress and keep sight of the big picture.
The first Saturday or Sunday of the month sounds like a thing.
I guess I should pick a day on which I feel a bit mentally tired as the review
would not be something requring too much creative and problem solving energy.

- GAMEPLAY IDEA
The player can start out at a very spiritualy clean community where demon
manifestations are few and far between and practice on general cleanup before
answering calls to more serious cases.
Casting away demons in secular comunities and cities would be something more
challenging as hevy demonisation would be more common and there would be
signifficantly more and stronger demons in the second heaven in those places
and even making their way into the natural (the first heaven) now and again.
And I'm not even talking about places where the communities of the darker art
practitioners would gather - that's a wole another level.

- DEMON HIERARCHY IDEA
The demons could be sorted in tiers like "Emperor", "King",
"Lord / Principal(ity)", "Captain", "Leutenant" with the "Prince of Darkness"
above them. Also possibly a few lower tiers to distinguish between the pawns.
As the "tier I" "tier II" seems rather dull and even unrepresentative of 
the gameworld.

- SPELL IDEA
[SUMMON SWORDS](think of a better name)
The caster summons several flying swords in a certain area (or within a
certain perimeter around the target) which homm in on the targer to pierce it.
