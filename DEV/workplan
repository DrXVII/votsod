=== Objectives =================================================================
(to reach version 0.01.0)
- [x] Organise project repository
- [x] Create an initial design for the engine core
- [x] Refactor and review old code
- [x] Flesh out engine core
-- [x] housekeeping
-- [x] core mechanics
-- [x] basic AI/mobs
-- [x]basic UI
- basic random level generation
- line of sight

=== Steps ======================================================================
# [x] Organise project repository
---------------------------------
- [x] check and throw out the unnecessary doc files left over form asciiworld
-- [x] text docs, ideas, etc
-- [x] xmind project maps
-- [x] diagrams
- [x] reorganise code files in repo
-- [x] deicide on the repo structure
-- [x] create a makefile

# [x] Create an initial design for the engine core
--------------------------------------------------
- [x] create a basic dia diagram to have a visualisation and work from there

# [x] Refactor and review old code
----------------------------------
- [x] refactor code distribution to comply with K&R-Stroustrup style
- [x] refactor naming to comply with K&R-Stroustrup style
- [x] review the code and remember the old work and loose ends

# [x] Flesh out engine core
---------------------------
(the idea is to make a reusable engine skeleton)

## [x] housekeeping
- [x] refactor code. The current style is inconsistent and quite far from ISO,
	which suggests K&R

## [x] core mechanics
- [x] reintroduce wall collisions
-- [x] create a System class to serve as higher level handler of procesess
-- [x] implement actor movement handling in the Map class
- [x] implement treating of the main char as one of the char objects in the map
	and render as such. (Throw away the hard-stamped '@' at middle of view-port
	placeholder)
-- [x] Char array in map should contain the main character as well
-- [x] reconfigure viewport accordingly

## basic AI/mobs
- basic mobs
-- [x] introduce an AI-less mob (let's consider it a training dummy :D )
-- [x] implement basic mob AI (only homing for now)

## basic UI
- [x] display hp (later other common information) on the sidebar
- ability to check stats (suggestion: map to 'c')

## basic random level generation
- generate a random level (for now some generic rooms connected with corridors)
-- [x] room generation
-- [x] radnomise room generation
-- random corridors, most leading to a room
-- level feature overlapping prevention

## line of sight
- basic line of sight (no worries about obstacles for now)
-- player (render only visible tiles)
-- mob AI behaviour
