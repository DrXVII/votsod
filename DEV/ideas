=== Ideas ======================================================================
# Gameplay mechanics
-----------------------
- Levels of illumination
-- Calculate per tile
-- Effects on line of sight
-- Illuminating with objects (sconces, carried torches or other equipment)

- Flowing fluids.
- outdoor environments
- tiles passable only for actors with certain gear/effect/abiltiy
- perception based on senses like sight, smell, hearing and additional uncommon or supernatural senses granted as innate abilities of mobs or as a buff to the player by some unconventional means
- locales with caves/areas that seem as a (multilevel) map by themselves, but stay persistent until locale is forgotten.

# Gameplay
----------
- The player will have the ability to enter a person's inner world at certain
	circumstances. Each world will have a certain flavour depending on the
	main principality/inhabitants. Each world will be unique as it will be
	randomly generated each time in accordance to the prevalent theme of the
	level.
- In the levels, some rooms/areas could have special effects, events, purpose...
- Maybe have more than 2 planes of existence and/or pocket dimensions
