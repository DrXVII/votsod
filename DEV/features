(core)
- Large dungeon levels with some rooms/regions having special characteristics
- Different styles of levels, and/or areas in levels (still randomly generated):
 - traditional rooms and corridors (level style)
 - round rooms (location/level style)
 - halls with and without pillars (location/level style)
 - rooms and walk-through rooms, few corridors [diablo-like, diablo2 dungeons] (level style)
 - outer and inner sanctum (level style)
 - traditional church rooms (location)
 - chapels (location)
 - non-traditional church rooms (location)
- Unlit tiles and tiles outside of sight are not displayed at all, 
making it rather difficult to retrace.
- A recurring town, retaining the things you left there, appearing now and then
all around the dungeon. (every level?) Offering things to buy, sell, refuge,
healing, etc. (npc party members can be found, recruited here? (hunting
parties?, for specific type(s) of mobs?))

(?)
- mobs can be grouped, certain groups would be native to a certain type of a
level or locale.

(???)
- question: will the levels be fully persistent or maybe just to an extent. ?
- (?parts of a level may change with time)

(?????)
- what's the END-GAME? Is there a certain reachable goal? - Should be I think,
at least in the dungeon (maybe a boss and an exit out? hmm? sounds nice :) )
