[19:24:42] Changed heading.
[19:25:30] Changer the wellcome screen.
[20:03:37] Created character, basic movement and rendering capabilities.
I'm calling this v0.0.02
[20:31:36] Fixed the map print algorithm and resized to leave bottom for info 
in future UI implementations.
[20:43:23] The base map filling algorhythm is now fully tested and working.

[15:12:33] Implemented level building from an ASCII text file.
[15:13:38] Due to it being more efficient to load the level line by line as
opposed to column by column, changed the games display coordinate profile to
y,x instead of x,y.

[20:53:30] Made a change plan and a few options to weigh the effect of the chang
es in the long run. Inclined to make a single array of mobs in the Map object, I
believe this will result in less work later.

[14:05:15] Created the first version of the bestiary.
[16:19:13] Changed the  character class hierarchy and created an array of
characters in the Map object. The collision detection is no longer available for
the moment, but these changes should save time in the future.

- makefile made
- project moved to a git repository synching wit github

[NEW SESSION] : 2016-04-26[23:00:00]Sunday
[01:00:00] Analyzed most of the old code, lots will have to change
- begun implementing the System class
- decided on the object structure for engine core
- rewriting 75% of the program seems plausible in contrast to massive
  code refactoring

[NEW SESSION] : 2016-04-29[18:51:25]Friday
[20:33:06] Reintroduced wall collisions, completely remade this time.
 - note to self though: sometimes there's less pain rewriting a small project
than refactoring the code and trying to remember what was where. Especially
when the code was abandoned with nothing even remotely tidied.
 - allso: mothballing is a thing.

[23:03:05] Spent about 4h today
- fixed quite a few iffy parts of code
- silenced all compiler warnings
- made the first mob! The "watcher"... he is currently quite dull though, as he 
has no  AI implemented yet. But that will be quite enough to train on when a bas
ic combat systemwill take shape.
- allso implemented mob-related player movement and collision handling.
- we're ready and rearin to go towards combat and AI!

[22:16:01] combat an AI
- there are finally mobs capable of fighting (and killing) the hero
- allso, found time to add functionality to prolog and will ad 3h, which I spent
creating the AI and combat. The AI is pretty basic for now, just homming to the
hero's coordinates... But it's PROGRESS! especially after a week of absence...
- SO were redy to go to level generation and then line of sight.

[07:16:03] Figured out how to move the AI and player movement handling into
the Actor class without it conflicting with the declarations made in Map.
[07:55:53] partially moved player movement logic to Actor class
will continue with that tomorrow and then move the AI logic there aswell.

[07:56:16] Moved the actor movement handling functionality into the Actor class
and started with moving the AI. Next time should work on placing the movement
functionality into a separate module to be used both by player input and by
the different AIs, then finalise AI integration with the new modular structure.
[08:00:19] Spent around 1h30m in total today. Time to make breakfast and go to
work :)

[21:31:34] Random level generation
- came up with a possible algorithm (on paper)
- expanded Map functionality to dynamically adapt when we want to place some
tiles outside of the current size of the map.
- implemented some functionality to generate rooms based on random parameters,
still need to implement corridor generation and colission checking to prevent
new architectural features from overlapping.

passable tile if the actor add funciton gets request to place an actor where
he would not be able to walk.
