----->Move character into the map object<-----
Option 1.
- Create a Char object in the map object
- Change the viewport to extract the portion of the map using main char coords

Option 2. [probably better in the long run]
- Create an array of char objects in the Map object
- place main char in the array
- reconfigure viewport accordingly
			v	v	v
- later base the mob class inheritance off of the Character class
- then the main char and all the mobs and npc's would perform their turns as
system iterates through the array
