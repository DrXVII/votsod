(core)
-> Large dungeon levels with some rooms/regions having special characteristics
-> Unlit tiles and tiles outside of sight are not displayed at all, 
making it rather difficult to retrace.
-> A recurring town, retaining the things you left there, appearing now and then
all around the dungeon. (every level?) Offering things to buy, sell, refuge,
healing, etc. (npc party members can be found, recruited here? (hunting
parties?, for specific type(s) of mobs?))

->
- question: will the levels be fully persistent or maybe just to an extent. ?
- (?parts of a level may change with time)
